Current agenda:
	- Move to RUST so we have a single binary
	- 

Features:
	- NO more command then text workflow, its bad
		- All entries are tasks
		- Any time you put a '-' at the start, it's a note
		- any time you put some number of '*' at the start, it belongs to it's own 'thread'
		- any time you put """ at the start, its a journal entry
			- and you close it by typing """
				OMG
		
		- Any time you put '/' at the start, its a command
	- Nothing task, ability to finish tasks and be doing nothing
		- or at least tagging tasks with some tag and being able to filter based on that tag
	-
