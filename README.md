# Python journal
Console program for timestamped logging of journal entries/tasks, and then analyzing time usage.

I will probably use this program every day.

Run the program by calling `python journaling.py` with a terminal in the root directory.

The program has it's own documentation inside itself that can be viewed with it's /help command.
